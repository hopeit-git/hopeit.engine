# hopeit engine

**"Microservices with Data Streams"**

*hopeit.engine* is a library that allows development and deployment of reactive, data driven microservices in Python. It provides a way to create APIs, implement business and data driven applications in Python, communicate between services using data streams, test, deploy and scale services. It also provides a flexible way to design, understand, run and visualize your apps, events and data dependencies.

### Motivation

**Small organizations**: *hopeit.engine* is intended initially to enable small organizations and companies, which don't have a huge software development infrastructure, to create new systems with the benefits of microservices: quick to develop, simple and small, easy to maintain and operate. These characteristics allow also migration of existing systems piece by piece to microservices. But that's not all: *hopeit.engine* adds a few features and good practices that all production-grade microservices must have out-of-the-box: modularity, scalability, logging, tracking/tracing, stream processing, metrics and monitoring. 

**Learning:** A second objective, but not less important is learning: if you want to learn how to develop microservices, *hopeit.engine* is a good starting point, since it will quickly make you productive and at the same time you will learn all the necessary steps and features that a production-grade microservice should have. Only basic Python knowledge is required. *hopeit.engine* was successfully adopted by Full-stack and Backend Software Developers, Data Engineers, and Data Scientists coming from different backgrounds.

**Data driven**: *hopeit.engine* was thought keeping in mind that most business logic and decisions are and will be driven by data. Working with data is a key part of the library. We embrace [*dataclasses*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html), we call them [*dataobjects*], and enforce data-types checking on input and output data. The library provides Open API validation and documentation and a way to share data between applications using streams. *hopeit.engine* is Data Science/Machine Learning friendly. We try to keep the library compatible with Python ecosystem around Machine Learning: Jupyter Notebooks and the Scientific Stack. We aim to enable Data Teams to create their own services in a way people with different skills can contribute.

**Streams**: *hopeit.engine* provides the main necessary features for your system to accomplish the objectives of modern, reactive systems: responsiveness, resiliency, scalability and message-driven. The architecture enforced by *hopeit.engine* will lead you to develop small stateless services, primarily running asynchronous operations, that can recover from failure, can scale up quickly and handle more load, and communicate asynchronously with other services and process data using streams.

**For production**: Even if *hopeit.engine* is in an early stage of development and many things can be improved, we aim to ease the steps needed to put microservices in production. *hopeit.engine* provides out of the box logging of app events with extra information that allows monitor, track, and measure requests. It's easily configurable to run in containers and allows extensibility using plugins to add the pieces you need to integrate new microservices in your organization: i.e. plugins are available to integrate authentication and monitoring into your existing infrastructure.

Microservices architecture is proven to be an efficient way that allows systems to grow and adapt, being adopted since years now by mainstream internet and e-commerce companies. If you are small organization and want to start modernizing and scaling, *hopeit.engine* can help you start quickly. If you are already running microservices or you are running a bigger infrastructure, *hopeit.engine* can help you create new features that will be easily integrated with your current services.

## Architecture

A few examples of how microservices can be architected using *hopeit.engine*

### Concepts:

**App**: is a conceptual unit implementing a cohesive piece of behavior, consisting of at least a configuration file plus a python module. An app implements one or many *Events*.

**Event**: is the basic execution unit that is triggered when an endpoint is invoked, or a message is received from a stream. Events can be of GET, POST, STREAM or SERVICE types. GET and POST are triggered from HTTP calls, STREAM when a message is consumed from a data stream and SERVICE events can run continuously. 

**Steps**: each Event can define a list of Steps to be executed when the event is triggered. *hopeit.engine* ensures the ordered execution of steps and dependency based on its inputs/outputs, allowing each step to be concise and independently testable.

**Plugin**: a special type of App that can extend other Apps functionality.

**Server**: a group of Apps and Plugins, a server configuration file plus an Open API specification file can run together using hopeit.server.web module.

Check [Simple Example Application](apps/examples/simple-example) for examples of supported event types, steps, configuration and Open API specification files. 


### A Simple Microservice

![Simple Microservice](docs/source/readme/hopeit.engine-simple.png)

In this schema, we can see a service or *App* created using hopeit.engine. The app orchestrates the implementation for two *Events*, each one accessible using an API endpoint. When an external client sends requests to the route associated with the event, the engine will trigger the execution of the steps defined in the event. Multiple events are served concurrently (but not necessarily in parallel) using [*asyncio*](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html)

### Composing API

![Compose](docs/source/readme/hopeit.engine-compose.png)

Many Apps can generate a single API specification and run together in a service unit. This sometimes could be desired to simplify operations. This is useful in small organizations where you don't want to deal with a lot of microservices to manage at the beginning. Later on, the apps can be detached easily and run separately if required.

### Streams

![Streams](docs/source/readme/hopeit.engine-streams.png)

If an external request triggers a process that requires background tasks to run, the process can be split in many events, and even in many services using streams. In this example App 1 is receiving the request and can quickly respond to the client while submitting a message to a *stream*. This is easily configurable just adding a *write_stream* section on the App configuration file. Then a second microservice (App 2) consumes the messages in the stream and performs extra processing, in this example, finally saving the result to a database. This is a powerful tool for reactive systems to use. Streams are not only fast, but they allow to design the systems in a modular way, keep every piece small while providing resiliency especially on data processing scenarios. Check the tutorials on how to develop events that can publish and consume events from streams [here](https://hopeitengine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/05-streams.html)

### Scalability and operations

![Scale](docs/source/readme/hopeit.engine-scale.png)

*hopeit.engine* enforces your Apps implementation to be scalable. We mentioned that events are served concurrently using asyncio, but to achieve real parallelism, many instances of an App can run in the same or different server instances. Putting a load balancer (i.e: [NGINX](https://nginx.org/en/) or [HAProxy](http://www.haproxy.org/), in front of your API Server app instances, will ensure serving a high load of requests in parallel. The same scalability/load-balancing pattern applies to stream events processing. You can run many instances of Apps consuming Redis Streams. Using consumer groups, Redis will act as a load-balancer and each App instance will consume events from the stream in parallel. Apps created with *hopeit.engine* are also easy to deploy in containers, like [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Only a Python runtime and a load-balancer is needed.

## Current status and roadmap

The framework is stable and running in production by early adopters with no major issues. 
It's also being tested and used in new projects. Now we are focusing in bug-fixing,
complete requested new features and optimize small pieces of the software.

- **APRIL 2022**: `hopeit.engine` `0.15.0` adds support to persist data directly from streams with zero-code approach using 
`hopeit.fs_storage` plugin. Initially it supports saving data in batches to the file system using folders as partitions.
This can be easily extended to persist in databases or cloud storage services like S3 or GCS.

- **JANUARY 2022**: `hopeit.engine` `0.13.0` ensures support for Python 3.10 and updates `aiohttp` to latest version. 
`0.14.0` adds support to return `web.StreamResponse` in chunks. 

- **AUGUST 2021**: `hopeit.engine` in `0.11.0` apps configuration is simplified by adding a `settings` section. General
improvements in engine steps execution. `0.12.0` updates components and fixes dataobject issues.

- **JULY 2021**: `hopeit.apps_client` plugin was created and `hopeit.engine` `0.9.0` released and improved in `0.10.0`. This plugin allows invoking
GET/POST endpoints on other hopeit Apps, supporting common microservices patterns as retrying and circuit breaking.
`hopeit.apps_visualizer` plugin now allows live monitoring of services activity on multiple servers since `0.7.0`, it was enhanced with
live monitoring and interactive filters of apps and hosts in `0.8.0` and from `0.9.0` it can be
used to visualize app dependencies either through streams or configured `app_connections` used by `apps_client`.

- **JUNE 2021**: `hopeit.engine` version 0.4.0 introduced app-visualizer plugin, that allows viewing in a web browser the current running configuration and dependencies between apps and events of a deployment. Also, enhanced stream processing by adding support for multiple queues for the same stream. In version 0.5.0 we started adding more DevOps tools: the first one is `log-streamer` plugin, which allows to parse app logs and send data to a stream. This will be used to monitor applications and dump logs to persistent storage. Combining `log-streamer` with `apps-visualizer` plugins, live activity visualization of events execution and stream processing is possible since version 0.6.0.

- **MAY 2021**: `hopeit.engine` version 0.3.0 released: we moved the modules redis-storage, readis-streams and fs-storage to independent plugins; Python 3.9 is now supported. Please check [release-notes](docs/source/release-notes.rst) for minor breaking changes made to configuration files.

- **APRIL 2021**: `hopeit.engine` version 0.2.0 released with multipart uploads support, fixes and improvements over existing functionality.

- **FEBRUARY 2021**: `hopeit.engine` version 0.1.5 is released on PyPI, enjoy!

- **JULY 2020**: `hopeit.engine` version 0.1.0 is released as Open Source in github!
